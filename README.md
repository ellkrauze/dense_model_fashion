# Analysis of the Quality of Neural Network Training
> How to create your own neural network and train it on the dataset. 

> **TAGS:** Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy; FashionMnist dataset

**Code is divided by several parts:**
- Loading data
- Image dimension conversion
- Data normalization
- Converting tags to categories
- Creating a sequentional neural network
- Adding layers
- Compiling the model
- Training the model
- Assessing the quality of network training on test data (Accuracy Score)
